# FitsApp Todos

#### Hey Andres, 
thanks for taking your time to look through this.

I checked the pods into the repo, just to make sure, so `pod install` shouldn't be necessary.

I was away yesterday, so I could only really start work this morning, so I spend around the 2nd to the last commit on this.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get the searchbar to woerk yet, but I found out it's due to an issue where the Navigationcontroller and Searchbar don't  play well together.
That can appereantly be fiuxed by outsourcing the navbar into a seperate .xib and subclassing it, but the the time constraint you folks set that won't be possible.
